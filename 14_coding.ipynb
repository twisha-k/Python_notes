Now, imagine that you close the curtains of the window and block the sunlight from entering the room. In this situation, the room would be darker and the visibility would be low.\n",

        "The same principle is applied in searching for an exoplanet. There are billions of galaxies in the universe. These galaxies have millions of stars. One such galaxy is the Milky-way galaxy in which our solar system exists. The solar system has a star called Sun which has its own light. In astronomy, a star is a heavenly body which has its own light. There are 8 planets in our solar system orbiting around the Sun. Similar to this, in some other galaxy there would be a star and probably a planet would be revolving around that star.\n",

While learning, the computer tries to find a pattern in the data, how one information affects another, which information is the most critical one, etc.\n",
