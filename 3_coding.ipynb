        "In this class, we are going to improve our Mind Reader algorithm so that it can make better predictions instead of making predictions randomly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this new algorithm, we will store the count of the player inputs. Essentially, we will keep a count of `0` and `1`. At every player input, we will check which count value is greater between the counts of `0` and `1`.\n",

        "- If the count of `0` is greater, the computer will predict `0`. Else if the count of `1` is greater, the computer will predict `1`.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Create four variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - `count_zero` - to store the count of the number of times a player has entered `0`.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - `count_one` - to store the count of the number of times a player has entered `1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - `player_score` - to keep the score of a player.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - `computer_score` - to keep the score of the computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create a function and name it `prediction()`. This is to predict `0` or `1` as an output by comparing the values stored in the `count_zero` and `count_one` variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - If `count_zero > count_one`, the function should return `0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Else if `count_one > count_zero`, the function should return `1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Else if `count_zero == count_one`, the function should return `0` or `1` randomly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Create another function and name it `update_counts()` to update the `count_zero` and `count_one` values based on the player inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - If the player input is `0`, the `count_zero` value should increase by `1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Else if the player input is `1`, the `count_one` value should increase by `1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Create another function and name it `update_scores()` to update the `player_scores` and the `computer_scores` as the game progresses.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - If the predicted value is same as the `player_input` value, increase the `computer_score` value.\n",
